As the wind does blow
Across the trees I see the
Buds blooming in May

I walk across sand
And find myself blistering
In the hot hot heat

Falling to the ground
I watch a leaf settle down
In a bed of brown.

It's cold and I wait
For someone to shelter me
And take me from here.

I hear crackling
Crunch of today's new found day
And know it won't last

So I will leave it
At bay; and hope for the best
This bitter new day
